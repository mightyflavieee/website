# flaviorizzoglio.dev

This is repository houses my personal portfolio website. Feel free to clone the repository and use the project as a template.

This website is built using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework and components are styled with the use of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## ðŸš€ Startup

This project utilizes **yarn**. Initially, clone the repository and run

```
yarn install
```

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

The project follows the standard Astro structure, organized like this:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Inside the _**src/pages/**_ directory, each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The _**src/components/**_ directory houses the _**.astro**_ components used to build the different layouts and pages.

Static assets, like images, are placed in the _**public/**_ directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                                   |
